This project initially started out as a React- Firestore webapp hosted locally using node.js

Following further development this web app is now being hosted on firebase at the below directory:

The project itself is prettty simplistic; utilising built in react hooks to manage state, and also implements custom hooks used to interact with the firebase backend.
